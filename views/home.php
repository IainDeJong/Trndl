    In the future, machines will do our jobs. In the now, they can do our job-application. Use the <b>Trndl Cover Letter Draft Generator</b> to create a custom made letter of application to any job.<br><br>
    Please remember that <b>Trndl</b> only creates drafts. You will have to check your generated letter on errors and suitability before you send it out. Also try to throw around some of the scentences before you send out your final version, just to make the letter feel more personal.</b><br><br>
    Also, <b>Trndl</b> is still a work in progress. Have fun with it, but don't use it to apply to that one shot position at NASA. </b><br><br>
